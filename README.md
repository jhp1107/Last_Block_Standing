# Last_Block_Standing

Last Block Standing (LBS) is a partisan combinatorial game similar in appearance to the tabletop game “Don’t Break The Ice.” It is played on an mxn board of squares, with each square being colored either blue, red, or green. On a player's turn, the player choses a square to remove. If it is the left player’s turn, they have to choose either a blue or green square and if it is the right player’s turn, they have to choose either a red or a green square. After the player removes their square, but before the other player removes one, all of the squares that are no longer a part of an entire row or an entire column are removed from play. Under normal play, the last player to make a legal move is deemed the winner.

This program allows a user to either analyze a game, play against another player, or play against the computer. In order to do either of these, you must first have a .txt file that represents the board. Reference impartialLBS3x3.txt to see the model of a board. It can contain the characters 'B' for a blue block, 'R' for a red block, 'G' for a green block, or '-' for a fallen block.
